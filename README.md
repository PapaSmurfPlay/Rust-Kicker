Gonna Learn Some Stuff

I have no idea what I'm doing. I saw a video that made me **bold** enough to play around in github. I'll learn it bit by bit.
I have a lot to offer, so it is my home that this will be the beginning of an eye-catching portfolio.

I'm spending this time in the README file because it is a Markdown file. I've gotten about a year and half worth of experience with Markdown, specifically R Markdown as part of Executive Masters in Public Policy (EMPP) program. I have also spent that time manipulating/mutating data, running regression and other analysis on large data sets (37,000 + rows of data). I've also created some charts and plots for visualization purposes, but to be honest, I'm not the best at them....**yet**. 

I've done a replication (with extention) of a previous study (which is where the 37,000 + rows of data came from).

I have more to add, but I'm sleepy, so we'll pick this back up soon.
