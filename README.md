## Objective
After learning a couple of programming languages, I found myself looking for different ways to get into tech, but I wasn't sure what path was best for me. To be honest, I'm still not sure, so this is my attempt to figure that out. In recent years, I've found myself drawn to the cybersecurity field. I see it as an opportunity to do challenging work, learn new skills, and (hopefully) do my part to make people safe and secure. It is my goal to take that passion and turn it in to functional skills that add value to an organization. Ideally I am seeking to become a SOC Analyst and grow from there. 

I saw a video that made me **bold** enough to play around in github. I aim to learn it bit by bit.

So far, I've been spending my time in the README file because it is a Markdown file. I've gotten about a year and half worth of experience with Markdown, specifically R Markdown as part of Executive Masters in Public Policy (EMPP) program. I have also spent that time manipulating/mutating data, running regression and other analysis on large data sets (37,000 + rows of data). I've also created some charts and plots for visualization purposes, but to be honest, I'm not the best at them....**yet**. 

I've done a replication (with extention) of a previous study (which is where the 37,000 + rows of data came from).
